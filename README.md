# Turnover Analysis Project

Employee turnover is a significant challenge for companies. Every time an employee leaves, the organization incurs costs and time delays related to new interviews and the training of replacements. Additionally, productivity in the affected department often suffers due to this turnover.

There are various reasons why employees may leave a company, such as better job opportunities, poor organizational culture, ineffective management, or a lack of work-life balance, among others.

In light of this, the HR department commissioned a data analyst to answer the following key question:

What company policies or factors should change to reduce employee turnover?

To investigate the characteristics that influence whether an employee stays or leaves, HR collected data on 1,470 employees who either left or remained with the company over the past year. The goal of this project is to analyze this data and provide actionable insights to help minimize turnover, particularly in the tech industry.
